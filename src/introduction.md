# Introduction

This course is intended to help non-software-engineers upskill in Python and
Data Engineering. No prior knowledge is assumed.

If you find any issues, or want to propose improvements, please file an issue or
raise a pull request over on
[GitHub](https://github.com/dewcservices/data-engineering-upskilling). If you
don't know what GitHub is yet, that is OK. You will soon enough.

This course is broken down into three main parts:

1. [Basics](./basics): Learn about virtual machines, Linux, the command line,
   and version control.
2. [Python](./python): Learn how to program in Python.
3. [Data engineering](./data-eng): Learn the fundamentals of data engineering,
   and use Python to solve practical problems.

This course attempts to avoid introducing too much original material. Instead,
this course describes high level learning goals in a sensible order, and
redirects learners to high-quality third party resources as much as possible.
Please raise an
[issue](https://github.com/dewcservices/data-engineering-upskilling/issues) if
any of the links are dead.
