# Introduction

This course is intended to help non-software-engineers upskill in Python and
Data Engineering. No prior knowledge is assumed.

This course attempts to avoid introducing too much original material. Instead,
this course defines learning goals in a sensible order, and redirects learners
to high-quality third party resources as much as possible.

This course is broken down into three main parts:

1. [Basics](./basics): Learn about virtual machines, Linux, the command line,
   and version control.
2. [Python](./python): Learn how to program in Python.
3. [Data engineering](./data-eng): Learn the fundamentals of data engineering,
   and use Python to solve practical problems.

If you find any issues, or want to propose improvements, please file an issue or
raise a pull request over on
[GitHub](https://github.com/dewcservices/data-engineering-upskilling). If you
don't know what GitHub is yet, that is OK. You will soon enough.
