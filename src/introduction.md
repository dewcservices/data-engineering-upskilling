# Introduction

This course is intended to help non-software-engineers upskill in Python and
Data Engineering. No prior knowledge is assumed.

If you find any issues, or want to propose improvements, file an issue or raise
a pull request over on
[GitHub](https://github.com/dewcservices/data-engineering-upskilling). If you
don't know what GitHub is yet, that is OK. You will soon enough.

This course is broken down into three main parts:

1. [Basics](./basics): Learn about virtual machines, Linux, the command line,
   and version control.
2. [Python](./python): Learn the basics of the Python programming language.
3. [Data engineering](./data-eng): Learn about the basics of data engineering,
   and use Python to solve practical problems.
