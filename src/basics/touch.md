The `touch` command is one of the most straightforward yet useful utilities
available in Unix-like operating systems. It allows you to create empty files
and update file timestamps without altering their contents.

## Basic usage

The simplest way to use touch is to create a new file:

```bash
touch filename.txt
```

This creates an empty file called "filename.txt" if it doesn't already exist. If
the file does exist, touch updates its timestamp to the current time.

## Multiple files

Touch can handle multiple files in a single command:

```bash
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

## Practical applications

- Creating empty placeholder files for later use
- Updating file timestamps to trigger build processes
- Testing file permission scenarios
- Creating empty log files before starting services

The touch command is a small tool that exemplifies Unix philosophyâ€”doing one
thing well and working together with other commands to accomplish more complex
tasks.
